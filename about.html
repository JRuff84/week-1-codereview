    <p>"If you challenge yourself with the contrary, it's true, you may have to confront uncertainty and doubt; but if one truly strives to maintain a healthy respect & admiration for truth, one would be wise to abandon the worship of certainty altogether..." This quote was inspired by the works of William James, John Dewey and René Descartes fill me with a sense of excitement, curiosity and joy.</p>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been passionately curious about how things come into being and have challenged myself to see things from different perspectives. I’ve spent my life exploring the crossroads between creativity and technology. Everything has a story, but the real magic is in discovering the amazing and impactful ways in which to tell it. When you pay close attention to the details, moments of inspiration arise and the missing pieces to even the most complex of puzzles become self evident.</p>
