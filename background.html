      <h2>Where I've Been & What I've Done</h2>
      <p>I love to discover and explore new concepts and ideas as much as sharing that knowledge and supporting those around me to become the best version of themselves. I have an innate ability to train, mentor, and inspire others to develop a deeper understanding of problems that often result in creative solutions that offer outstanding results. This has opened many doors and opportunities for me. </p>

      <p>I've had the honor of working for Apple; serving clients such as Nike, DaimlerChrysler, Oceania Olympic Committee; as a musician; opening for and collaborating with Everclear, The Presidents of the United States of America, OneFromMany, Modest Mouse; and as an artist and graphic designer; working on creative endeavors that have been featured at Cannes and The Portland 24 Hour Festival.</p>

      <p>I simply love to create user experiences and solutions that expand boundaries and solve problems. With a dedication to customer satisfaction and finding genuine inspiration and brilliance within myself and others, I find joy in absorbing, sharing, and applying truth to everything I do. </p>
