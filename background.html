    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <h2>Oct 2018 - Present</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Paternity Leave & New Business - My wife and I welcomed our second son Lucas into the world in Dec. of last year and immediately following coming back from parental leave, my wife had the opportunity to leave the current position she was in and start her own Real Estate business. During this time I was needed to step into a support role for family duties in addition to professional ones, assisting in key areas while getting the new business up and off the ground including:
        <ul>
        <li>Technology Consultant, conducting research, establishing new workflow, setup of new software, & migration of data from previous systems to new platforms, graphic design work & branding material/collateral</li>
        <li>Showing Assistant - Client facing, assisting with showings and property tours, creating and editing property listings and related material for listings before going live, and staging properties for tours and media creation</li>

      <li>Home & Family - We have two boys, Harrison (4) and Lucas (9mo) and for the first few months before Lucas was old enough to start infant care, I stepped into a full support role holding down the fort at home & then transitioning to 50/50, aiding with my wifeâ€™s new business as soon as childcare became available and my skills were required and of value.
      </li>
    </ul>
